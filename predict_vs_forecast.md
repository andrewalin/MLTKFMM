# Clarifying what "Predict" means, in an ML context #

## Predict ##

Broad umbrella term.

Means to state what is likely given evidence, reasoning, or pattern recognition.

Can apply to:

 - Future events (e.g., “I predict it will rain tomorrow”)

 - Unknown present states (e.g., “I predict the card you picked is red”)

 - Even past events that are uncertain to us (e.g., “I predict the ship sank near this location”).

So, predict is about making a claim where truth is not yet known to the speaker, regardless of temporal orientation.

## Forecast ##

A narrower, domain-specific form of prediction.

Almost always future-oriented.

Typically involves systematic methods, models, or data (e.g., weather forecast, economic forecast, sales forecast).

Carries a connotation of projecting trends forward rather than guessing about hidden states.

## Relationship ##

So, you can think of it as:

Forecast ⊂ Predict

All forecasts are predictions.

But not all predictions are forecasts (because predictions can also concern hidden, present, or past states, and may not rely on formal models).
